# Security Research
> This is a collaborative effort created by GopherHack officers that aims to provide information and educate people about types of cyber attacks, topics, and etc. in the field of Cybersecurity.

# Example
> I want to write about types of SQL Injection, I propose my idea to the higher-level officers, and get access to this repository following the steps described in the Google Sheets file. From there on, I do my own work and just report back when I have everything setup. The material you have covered could be used by yourself to run a Wednesday meeting or a workshop, if you would like to.

# Audience
